Homomorphic encryption schemes enable computation over ciphertexts without knowing the related plaintexts or the decryption key. This work focuses on the challenge of developing an efficient implementation of the BFV scheme on CUDA. This is done by combining and adapting different literature approaches, as the double-CRT representation and the Discrete Galois Transform.

Designing an efficient protocol with the desired functionality has, however, been an open challenge for a long time. Recently, Di Crescenzo et al.

We progress along this path with the aim of LOVE (Lowering the cost of Outsourcing and Verifying Efficiently) a pairing. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a protocol (LOVE) that improves the efficiency of Di Crescenzo et al.’s proposal for securely delegating pairings with online, public inputs. Second, we provide the first implementation of efficient protocols in this setting. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our LOVE protocol in different application scenarios by benchmarking an implementation using BN, BLS12 and BLS24 pairing-friendly curves. Interestingly, compared to Di Crescenzo et al.’s protocol, LOVE is up to 29.7% faster for the client, up to 24.9% for the server and requires 23–24% less communication cost depending on the choice of parameters. Furthermore, we note that our LOVE protocol is especially suited for subgroup-secure groups: checking the correctness of the delegated pairing requires up to 56.2% less computations than evaluating the pairing locally (no delegation). This makes LOVE the most efficient protocol to date for securely outsourcing the computation of a pairing with online public inputs, even when the server is malicious.","tags":null,"title":"LOVE a Pairing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Guimarães","Edson Borin","Diego F.

In this paper, we introduce two methods to combine multiple functional bootstraps to accelerate the evaluation of reasonably large look-up tables and highly precise functions. We thoroughly analyze and experimentally validate the error propagation in both methods, as well as in the functional bootstrap itself. We leverage the multi-value bootstrap of Carpov et al.

However, little has been said about Cross-ISA emulation and its impact on timing leakages. In this paper, we investigate the impact of dynamic binary translators in the constant-time property of known cryptographic implementations, using different Region Formation Techniques (RFTs). We show that the emulation may have a significant impact by inserting non constant-time constructions during the translation, leading to significant timing leakages in QEMU and HQEMU emulators. These leakages are then verified using a statistical approach. In order to guarantee the constant-time property, we have implemented a solution in the QEMU dynamic binary translator, mitigating the inserted timing side-channels.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation and Mitigation of Timing Side-Channel Leakages on Multiple-Target Dynamic Binary Translators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

It is known that any small amount of nonce exposure or nonce bias can in principle lead to a full key recovery: the key recovery is then a particular instance of Boneh and Venkatesan's hidden number problem (HNP). That observation has been practically exploited in many attacks in the literature, taking advantage of implementation defects or side-channel vulnerabilities in various concrete ECDSA implementations. However, most of the attacks so far have relied on at least 2 bits of nonce bias (except for the special case of curves at the 80-bit security level, for which attacks against 1-bit biases are known, albeit with a very high number of required signatures). In this paper, we uncover LadderLeak, a novel class of side-channel vulnerabilities in implementations of the Montgomery ladder used in ECDSA scalar multiplication. The vulnerability is in particular present in several recent versions of OpenSSL.

However, recent studies have practically demonstrated that such de-randomized schemes, including EdDSA, are vulnerable to differential fault attacks, which enable adversaries to recover the entire secret signing key, by artificially provoking randomness reuse or corrupting computation in other ways. In order to balance concerns of both randomness failures and the threat of fault injection, some signature designs are advocating a ``hedged'' derivation of the per-signature randomness, by hashing the secret key, message, and a nonce. Despite the growing popularity of the hedged paradigm in practical signature schemes, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to formally analyze the fault resilience of hedged signatures. We perform a formal security analysis of the fault resilience of signature schemes constructed via the Fiat--Shamir transform. We propose a model to characterize bit-tampering fault attacks, and investigate their impact across different steps of the signing operation. We prove that, for some types of faults, attacks are mitigated by the hedged paradigm, while attacks remain possible for others.

Although smart meters tend to encrypt payloads using state-of-the-art solutions, the packet length variability introduced by compression of the data can be exploited in a side channel attack to gain knowledge about the consumption of individual meters. For example, a meter reporting constant (e.g. zero) consumption can be compressed more than one reporting more erratic usage. An attacker may gain knowledge of behavioral patterns of a household, e.g., when is no one home, or company, e.g., active periods of production. This paper analyzes the correlation between compressed packet length and reported consumption of multiple signals and practical reporting periods for the DLMS standard using real (anonymized) smart meter measurements. We consider various built-in compressors and also propose new techniques that can both increase the compression and reduce this correlation.

The insecure storage of cryptographic keys, hard-coded directly in source code and shared among all machines, allowed full content inspection of the software installation memory cards, after which two shared libraries missing authentication signatures were detected. Injecting code in the libraries allowed the execution of arbitrary code in the machine, violating the integrity of the voting software.

Our construction generalizes Boneh et al.’s linearly homomorphic signature scheme (PKC’09 [7]) to the multi-key setting and relies on basic tools of pairing-based cryptography. Compared to existing multi-key homomorphic signature schemes, our MKLHS is a conceptually simple and elegant direct construction, which trades-off privacy for efficiency. The simplicity of our approach leads us to a very efficient construction that enjoys significantly shorter signatures and higher performance than previous proposals. Finally, we implement MKLHS using two different pairing-friendly curves at the 128-bit security level, a Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve and a Barreto-Naehrig curve. Our benchmarks illustrate interesting performance trade-offs between these parameters, involving the cost of exponentiation and hashing in pairing groups.

With the increasing demand for low-cost devices, PUF designs which can effectively combine small silicon area and power consumption with high resistance to attacks have become of great interest. Unfortunately, many delay-based PUFs have revealed security weaknesses, making them less useful in such domains. This paper presents a novel delay-based strong PUF, the CRPUF (Cylindrical Reconvergence PUF). CRPUF is based on a carefully designed cylindrical XOR fabric, which allows for a large number of delay paths, thus producing a large combination of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) with relatively low transistor count. Simulations based on circuit delay variability models were performed to evaluate CRPUF with respect to well-known delay PUFs. The simulation results were then validated against an FPGA prototype to show that the desirable properties of the CRPUF can be obtained in a realistic physical implementation. Experiments show that CRPUF has Hamming Distance, Hamming Weight and Entropy comparable to the best results published so far, with acceptable levels of Bit Error Rate. Moreover, experiments also show that CRPUF is much more resistant to modeling attacks than other delay and some memory-based PUFs, making it a good candidate to systems which have stringent cost and security constraints.","tags":null,"title":"CRPUF: A modeling-resistant delay PUF based on cylindrical reconvergence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Otávio Oliveira Napoli","Vanderson Martins do Rosário","Diego de Freitas Aranha","Edson Borin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"943bc5695572daa6a7491b30dbf65fe9","permalink":"/publication/napolirab18/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/napolirab18/","section":"publication","summary":"Timing side-channel attacks are an important issue for cryptographic algorithms.

In particular, hash values of large collections can be computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a very useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity verification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding. Unfortunately, constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature are hampered by two main drawbacks: they tend to be much longer than usual hash functions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of 2^128, they are several thousand bits long, as opposed to 256 bits for usual hash functions), and they are also quite slow. In this paper, we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH), which combines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient encoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one hand, the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal: 2m-bit hash values provide O(2^m) collision resistance. On the other hand, we demonstrate a highly-efficient software implementation of ECMH, which our thorough empirical evaluation shows to be capable of processing over 3 million set elements per second on a 4 GHz Intel Haswell machine at the 128-bit security level---many times faster than previous practical methods.","tags":null,"title":"Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hilder V.

An ideal application for this approach is when an attacker is capable of sneaking a malicious device inside a protected perimeter and has remote control over a camera inside such perimeter. The device can then collect information and transmit directly to the attacker, without the need of recovering the device to obtain the captured information, erase evidence or prevent a forensic investigation.

Its design is based on 4-bit S-boxes and a 64-bit permutation, a far from optimal choice to achieve good performance in software. As a result, most software implementations require large lookup tables in order to meet efficiency goals. In this paper, we describe a new portable and efficient software implementation of PRESENT, fully protected against timing attacks. Our implementation uses a novel decomposition of the permutation layer, and bitsliced computation of the S-boxes using optimized Boolean formulas, not requiring lookup tables. The implementations are evaluated in embedded ARM CPUs ranging from microcontrollers to full-featured processors equipped with vector instructions. Timings for our software implementation show a significant performance improvement compared to the numbers from the FELICS benchmarking framework. In particular, encrypting 128 bits using CTR mode takes about 2100 cycles on a Cortex-M3, improving on the best Assembly implementation in FELICS by a factor of 8. Additionally, we present the fastest masked implementation of PRESENT for protection against timing and other side-channel attacks in the scenario we consider, improving on related work by 15%. Hence, we conclude that PRESENT can be remarkably efficient in software if implemented with our techniques, and even compete with a software implementation of AES in terms of latency while offering a much smaller code footprint.","tags":null,"title":"PRESENT Runs Fast - Efficient and Secure Implementation in Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edson Floriano","Eduardo Alchieri","Diego F.

Tuples stored in a tuple space are accessed by the contents of their fields, working as an associative memory. Although there are some proposals for secure tuple spaces, accessing tuples through field contents makes these systems susceptible to attacks that could impair user and data privacy, since servers must access tuple data. In order to deal with these limitations and provide privacy in the tuple space model, this paper proposes some extensions to DEPSPACE, a tuple space system that implements dependability and security properties through a set of mechanisms that are not enough to ensure privacy. The resulting system provides privacy and, at the same time, allows tuple selection/matches similar to the traditional insecure model, i.e., it does not constraint the matching possibilities. The main problem to be addressed is that servers must select tuples based on their contents without knowing them. The proposed solution uses robust cryptographic schemes, as order-preserving encryption and homomorphic encryption, to provide this functionality without revealing the tuple contents. An analysis concerning security aspects of DEPSPACE is presented, as well as the benefits of the proposed solutions. A set of experiments, executed with an implementation of the proposed protocols, shows the feasibility of the proposed solutions and shed some light on both the behavior of the system and the costs to provide privacy in the tuple spaces model.","tags":null,"title":"Providing privacy on the tuple space model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo B.

As the demand for IoT devices grows, the need for stronger authentication and access control mechanisms is greater than ever. Legacy authentication and access control mechanisms do not meet the growing needs of IoT. In particular, there is a dire need for a holistic authentication mechanism throughout the IoT device life-cycle, namely from the manufacturing to the retirement of the device. As a plausible solution, we present Authentication of Things (AoT), a suite of protocols that incorporate authentication and access control during the entire IoT device life span. Primarily, AoT relies on Identity- and Attribute-Based Cryptography to cryptographically enforce Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Additionally, AoT facilitates secure (in terms of stronger authentication) wireless interoperability of new and guest devices in a seamless manner. To validate our solution, we have developed AoT for Android smartphones like the LG G4 and evaluated all the cryptographic primitives over more constrained devices like the Intel Edison and the Arduino Due. This included the implementation of an Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) scheme. Our results indicate AoT ranges from highly efficient on resource-rich devices to affordable on resource-constrained IoT-like devices. Typically, an ABS generation takes around 27 ms on the LG G4, 282 ms on the Intel Edison, and 1.5 s on the Arduino Due.","tags":null,"title":"AoT: Authentication and Access Control for the Entire IoT Device Life-Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

With the increasing demand of low-cost devices, PUF designs which can effectively combine small silicon area and power consumption with high resistance to attacks have become of great interest. Unfortunately, many delay-based PUFs have revealed security weaknesses, making them less useful in such domains. This paper presents a novel delay-based strong PUF, the CRPUF (Cylindrical Reconvergence PUF). CRPUF is based on a carefully designed cylindrical XOR fabric, which allows for a large number of delay paths, thus producing a large combination of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) with relatively low transistor count. Simulations based on circuit delay variability models were performed to evaluate CRPUF with respect to well-known delay PUFs. Experimental results show that CRPUF has Hamming Distance, Hamming Weight and Entropy comparable to the best results published so far, with acceptable levels of Bit Error Rate. Moreover, experiments also show that CRPUF is much more resistant to modeling attacks than other delay and some memory-based PUFs, making it a good candidate to systems which have stringent cost and security constraints.","tags":null,"title":"Cylindrical Reconvergence Physical Unclonable Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rafael J.

This graph relies on Ferrante et al.'s notion of control dependences to represent implicit flows of information. A limitation of this approach is that it may create O(|I| × |E|) implicit flow edges in the PDG, where I are the instructions in a program, and E are the edges in its control flow graph. This paper shows that it is possible to compute information flow analyses using a different notion of implicit dependence, which yields a number of edges linear on the number of definitions plus uses of variables. Our algorithm computes these dependences in a single traversal of the program's dominance tree. This efficiency is possible due to a key property of programs in Static Single Assignment form: the definition of a variable dominates all its uses. Our algorithm correctly implements Hunt and Sands system of security types. Contrary to their original formulation, which required O(I 2) space and time for structured programs, we require only O(I). We have used our ideas to build FlowTracker, a tool that uncovers side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic algorithms. FlowTracker handles programs with over one-million assembly instructions in less than 200 seconds, and creates 24% less implicit flow edges than Ferrante et al.'s technique. FlowTracker has detected an issue in a constant-time implementation of Ellip-tic Curve Cryptography; it has found several time-variant constructions in OpenSSL, one issue in TrueCrypt and it has validated the isochronous behavior of the NaCl library.","tags":null,"title":"Sparse representation of implicit flows with applications to side-channel detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caio Hoffman","Mario Lúcio Côrtes","Diego F.

(ACM CCS 2013), which is simple but supports a somewhat limited set of elliptic curves, and its variant \"Elligator Squared\" suggested by Tibouchi (FC 2014), which is slightly more complex but supports arbitrary curves. Despite that complexity, it was speculated that Elligator Squared could have an efficiency edge in some contexts, as it avoids a rejection sampling step necessary for Elligator, and can be used with a larger class of point encoding functions, some of them very efficient. In this paper, we show that Elligator Squared can indeed be implemented very efficiently with a suitable choice of point encoding function. More pre-cisely, we consider the binary curve setting, and implement the Elligator Squared bit string representation algorithm based on a suitably optimized version of the Shallue–van de Woestijne characteristic 2 encoding. On the fast binary curve of Oliveira et al. (CHES 2013), our implementation runs in an average of only 22850 Haswell cycles. We also compare implementations of Elligator and Elligator Squared on a curve supported by Elligator, namely Curve25519, and find that generating a random point and its uniform bitstring representation is around 35–40% faster with Elligator for protocols using a fixed base point (such as static ECDH), but 30–35% faster with Elligator Squared in the case of a variable base point (such as ElGamal encryption).

In such implementations, a scalar multiplication [k]P is computed as a double multiplication [k1]P + [k2]ψ(P), for ψ an efficient endomorphism and k1,k2 appropriate half-size scalars. To compute a random scalar multiplication, one can either select the scalars k1,k2 at random, hoping that the resulting k = k1 + k2 λ is close to uniform, or pick a uniform k instead and decompose it as k1 + k2 λ afterwards. The main goal of this paper is to discuss security issues that may arise using either approach. When k1 and k2 are chosen uniformly at random in [0,√n) , n = ord(P), we provide a security proofs under mild assumptions. However, if they are chosen as random integers of   ⌊12log2n⌋  bits, the resulting k is slightly skewed, and hence not suitable for use in schemes like ECDSA. Indeed, for GLS curves, we show that this results in a bias of up to 1 bit on a suitable multiple of   kmodn , and that this bias is practically exploitable: while lattice-based attacks cannot exploit a single bit of bias, we demonstrate that an earlier attack strategy by Bleichenbacher makes it possible. In doing so, we set a record by carrying out the first ECDSA full key recovery using a single bit of bias. On the other hand, computing k1 and k2 by decomposing a uniformly random k ∈ [0,n) avoids any statistical bias, but the decomposition algorithm may leak side-channel information. Early proposed algorithms relied on lattice reduction and exhibited a significant amount of timing channel leakage. More recently, constant-time approaches have also been proposed, but we show that they are amenable to power analysis: we describe a template attack that can be combined with classical lattice-based attacks on ECDSA to achieve full key recovery on physiscal devices.","tags":null,"title":"GLV/GLS Decomposition, Power Analysis, and Attacks on ECDSA Signatures with Single-Bit Nonce Bias","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

Field arithmetic is carefully crafted by using the best formulae and implementation strategies available, and the increasingly common native support to binary field arithmetic in modern desktop computing platforms. The i-th power of the Frobenius automorphism on Koblitz curves is exploited to obtain new and faster interleaved versions of the well-known $τ$NAF scalar multiplication algorithm. The usage of the $τ^łfloor m/3 f̊loor$ and $τ^łfloor m/4 ł̊oor$ maps are employed to create analogues of the 3-and 4-dimensional GLV decompositions and in general, the $łfloor m/s o̊̊or$-th power of the Frobenius automorphism is applied as an analogue of an $s$-dimensional GLV decomposition. The effectiveness of these techniques is illustrated by timing the scalar multiplication operation for fixed, random and multiple points. To our knowledge, our library was the first to compute a random point scalar multiplication in less than 10^5 clock cycles among all curves with or without endomorphisms defined over binary or prime fields. The results of our optimized implementation suggest a trade-off between speed, compliance with the published standards and side-channel protection.

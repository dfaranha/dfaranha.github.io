They allow two parties to compute the intersection of their private sets without revealing any additional information beyond the intersection itself, for one party (one-way) or both parties (mutual). Despite the several PSI protocols available in the literature, only recently techniques have been applied to existing PSI protocols in order to make them more efficient when one of the parties holds a set much smaller than the other. This is a realistic scenario in many cases, characterizing the unbalanced setting. Thus, this paper builds on modern cryptographic engineering techniques and proposes optimizations for a promising one-way PSI protocol based on public-key cryptography secure against semi-honest adversaries.

In this paper, we introduce two methods to combine multiple functional bootstraps to accelerate the evaluation of reasonably large look-up tables and highly precise functions. We thoroughly analyze and experimentally validate the error propagation in both methods, as well as in the functional bootstrap itself. We leverage the multi-value bootstrap of Carpov et al.

Although tuple spaces provide the coordination functionalities, a recent study showed that extensibility is fundamental for performance. The main idea behind extensibility is to allow the servers, supporting the coordination infrastructure, to access and process coordination information. Consequently, it is not necessary to move information from servers to clients or to reprocess requests due to concurrency. Unfortunately, existing proposals for extensible distributed coordination do not provide security and privacy once servers access data in plaintext. This work uses robust cryptographic schemes recently integrated into DepSpace, a tuple space implementation, to propose secure protocols for coordination with and without extensions.

With the increasing demand for low-cost devices, PUF designs which can effectively combine small silicon area and power consumption with high resistance to attacks have become of great interest. Unfortunately, many delay-based PUFs have revealed security weaknesses, making them less useful in such domains. This paper presents a novel delay-based strong PUF, the CRPUF (Cylindrical Reconvergence PUF). CRPUF is based on a carefully designed cylindrical XOR fabric, which allows for a large number of delay paths, thus producing a large combination of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) with relatively low transistor count. Simulations based on circuit delay variability models were performed to evaluate CRPUF with respect to well-known delay PUFs. The simulation results were then validated against an FPGA prototype to show that the desirable properties of the CRPUF can be obtained in a realistic physical implementation. Experiments show that CRPUF has Hamming Distance, Hamming Weight and Entropy comparable to the best results published so far, with acceptable levels of Bit Error Rate. Moreover, experiments also show that CRPUF is much more resistant to modeling attacks than other delay and some memory-based PUFs, making it a good candidate to systems which have stringent cost and security constraints.","tags":null,"title":"CRPUF: A modeling-resistant delay PUF based on cylindrical reconvergence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karima Velasquez","David Perez Abreu","Marcio R.

Tuples stored in a tuple space are accessed by the contents of their fields, working as an associative memory. Although there are some proposals for secure tuple spaces, accessing tuples through field contents makes these systems susceptible to attacks that could impair user and data privacy, since servers must access tuple data. In order to deal with these limitations and provide privacy in the tuple space model, this paper proposes some extensions to DEPSPACE, a tuple space system that implements dependability and security properties through a set of mechanisms that are not enough to ensure privacy. The resulting system provides privacy and, at the same time, allows tuple selection/matches similar to the traditional insecure model, i.e., it does not constraint the matching possibilities. The main problem to be addressed is that servers must select tuples based on their contents without knowing them. The proposed solution uses robust cryptographic schemes, as order-preserving encryption and homomorphic encryption, to provide this functionality without revealing the tuple contents. An analysis concerning security aspects of DEPSPACE is presented, as well as the benefits of the proposed solutions. A set of experiments, executed with an implementation of the proposed protocols, shows the feasibility of the proposed solutions and shed some light on both the behavior of the system and the costs to provide privacy in the tuple spaces model.","tags":null,"title":"Providing privacy on the tuple space model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy Maitin-Shepard","Mehdi Tibouchi","Diego F.

In particular, hash values of large collections can be computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a very useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity verification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding. Unfortunately, constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature are hampered by two main drawbacks: they tend to be much longer than usual hash functions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of 2^128, they are several thousand bits long, as opposed to 256 bits for usual hash functions), and they are also quite slow. In this paper, we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH), which combines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient encoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one hand, the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal: 2m-bit hash values provide O(2^m) collision resistance.

The implementations target the Cortex-M and Cortex-A families of ARM processors. These devices are located towards the mid to lower-end of the spectrum of ARM architectures, and are typical of scenarios considered for lightweight cryptography , such as the Internet of Things.

The idea was based on two aspects: distributed collection of poll tape pictures, taken by voters using mobile devices; and crowdsourced comparison of these pictures with the partial electronic results published by the electoral authority. The solution allowed voters to verify if results were correctly transmitted to the central tabulator without manipulation, with granularity of individual polling places. We present results, discuss limitations of the approach and future perspectives, considering the context of the previous Brazilian presidential elections of 2014, where the proposed solution was employed for the first time. In particular, with the aid of our project, voters were able to verify 1.6 % of the total poll tapes, amounting to 4.1 % of the total votes, which prompted the electoral authority to announce improved support for automated verification in the next elections. While the case study relies on the typical workflow of a paperless DRE-based election, the approach can be improved and adapted to other types of voting technology.","tags":null,"title":"Crowdsourced integrity verification of election results - An experience from Brazilian elections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

We propose a security solution for this scenario. While previous works have provided security support for various communication patterns in sensor networks, such as among nodes, from nodes to a base station, and from users to nodes, the security of communication from sensor nodes to multiple users has not been sufficiently addressed. Specifically, we explore this design space and develop a security solution, named Secure Tiny Web Service, for efficient authentication of data sent by a resource-constrained sensor node to multiple users, using digital signatures. We investigate the resource overheads in communication and computation of four suitable signature schemes—the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, the (elliptic curve) Schnorr signature, and the Boneh–Lynn–Shacham and Zhang–Safavi-Naini–Susilo short signature schemes. We implement these schemes on two popular sensor node architectures (based on AVR ATmega128L and MSP430 processors with 802.15.4 radios) and experimentally characterize relevant trade-offs.","tags":null,"title":"Secure-TWS: Authenticating Node to Multi-user Communication in Shared Sensor Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Taverne","Armando Faz-Hernández","Diego F.

Alternate strategies for implementing inversion and half-trace are examined to restore most of their competitiveness relative to the new multiplier. These improvements in field arithmetic are complemented by a study on serial and parallel approaches for Koblitz and random curves, where parallelization strategies are implemented and compared. The contributions are illustrated with experimental results improving the state-of-the-art performance of halving and doubling-based scalar multiplication on NIST curves at the 112- and 192-bit security levels and a new speed record for side-channel-resistant scalar multiplication in a random curve at the 128-bit security level.

Symmetric cryptosystems can perform it efficiently, but they often do not provide a perfect trade-off between resilience and storage. Further, even though conventional public key and elliptic curve cryptosystems are computationally feasible on sensor nodes, protocols based on them are not, as they require the exchange and storage of large keys and certificates, which is expensive. Using Pairing-Based Cryptography (PBC) protocols parties can agree on keys without any interaction. In this work, we (i) show how security in WSNs can be bootstrapped using an authenticated identity-based non-interactive protocol and (ii) present TinyPBC, to our knowledge, the most efficient implementation of PBC primitives for 8, 16 and 32-bit processors commonly found in sensor nodes. TinyPBC is able to compute pairings, the most expensive primitive of PBC, in 1.90 s on ATmega128L, 1.27 s on MSP430 and 0.14 s on PXA27x.

Our implementation of field multiplication and modular reduction algorithms focuses on the reduction of memory accesses and appears as the fastest result for this platform. Finite field arithmetic was implemented in C and Assembly and elliptic curve arithmetic was implemented in Koblitz and generic binary curves.

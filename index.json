In particular, HE enables to securely outsource data computation to the cloud. However, HE by itself offers no guarantee that the returned result was honestly computed by the cloud. In order to have such guarantees, it is necessary to add verifiable computation (VC) mechanisms into the system. The most efficient recent works in the area of VC over HE focus on verifying operations on the ciphertext space of the HE scheme, which usually lacks the algebraic structure that would make it compatible with existing proof and argument systems. Namely, in the current most efficient HE schemes, operations such as multiplication of ciphertexts require non-algebraic operations such as real division and rounding. Therefore, the existing techniques for verifiable computation on HE require us to either give up on those efficient HE schemes, or incur a large overhead in order to emulate these non-algebraic operations. In this work, we switch away from that paradigm by moving the verification checks to the plaintext space, all the while maintaining the overall correctness and privacy guarantees of the system. We achieve this through an adaptation of the FRI protocol [Ben Sasson et al., ICALP 2018] to work over HE and an adaptation of existing compilers from (Zero Knowledge, $δ$-correlated, holographic) Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOPs) into (zero knowledge) Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs). We work extensively on the parameters and algorithmic aspects of both FRI and HE so as to produce an implementation. While the full implementation of our protocol is still work in progress, we discuss some of these aspects, and provide operation counts within this abstract.","tags":null,"title":"A Practical Framework for Verifiable Computation over Encrypted Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Neumann","Antonio Guimarães","Diego F.

Among existing approaches, the homomorphic evaluation of ML algorithms stands out by performing operations directly over encrypted data, enabling strong guarantees of confidentiality. The homomorphic evaluation of inference algorithms is practical even for relatively deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). However, training is still a major challenge, with current solutions often resorting to lightweight algorithms that can be unfit for solving more complex problems, such as image recognition. This work introduces the homomorphic evaluation of Wilkie, Stonham, and Aleksander's Recognition Device (WiSARD) and subsequent Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) for training and inference on encrypted data. Compared to CNNs, WNNs offer better performance with a relatively small accuracy drop. We develop a complete framework for it, including several building blocks that can be of independent interest. Our framework achieves 91.7% accuracy on the MNIST dataset after only 3.5 minutes of encrypted training (multi-threaded), going up to 93.8% in 3.5 hours. For the HAM10000 dataset, we achieve 67.9% accuracy in just 1.5 minutes, going up to 69.9% after 1 hour. Compared to the state of the art on the HE evaluation of CNN training, Glyph (Lou et al., NeurIPS 2020), these results represent a speedup of up to 1200 times with an accuracy loss of at most 5.4%. For HAM10000, we even achieved a 0.65% accuracy improvement while being 60 times faster than Glyph. We also provide solutions for small-scale encrypted training. In a single thread on a desktop machine using less than 200MB of memory, we train over 1000 MNIST images in 12 minutes or over the entire Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset in just 11 seconds.","tags":null,"title":"Homomorphic WiSARDs: Efficient Weightless Neural Network training over encrypted data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

Curve-based cryptography is not different in this regard, and substantial progress in the last few decades has been achieved in both selecting parameters and devising secure implementation strategies. In this context, the security of implementations of field inversion is sometimes overlooked in the research literature, because (i) the approach based on Fermat’s Little Theorem (FLT) suffices performance-wise for many parameters used in practice; (ii) it is typically invoked only at the very end of a cryptographic computation, with a small impact on performance; (iii) it is challenging to implement securely for general parameters without a significant performance penalty. However, field inversion can process sensitive information and must be protected with side-channel countermeasures like any other cryptographic operation, as illustrated by recent attacks [1]–[3]. In this work, we focus on implementing field inversion for primes of cryptographic interest with security against timing attacks, irrespective of whether the FLT-based inversion can be efficiently implemented. We extend the Fiat-Crypto framework, which synthesizes provably correct-by-construction implementations, to implement the Bernstein-Yang inversion algorithm as a step towards this goal. This allows a correct implementation of prime field inversion to be synthesized for any prime. We benchmark the implementations across a range of primes for curve-based cryptography and they outperform traditional FLT-based approaches in most cases, with observed speedups up to 2 for the largest parameters. Our work is already used in production in the MirageOS unikernel operating system, zig programming language, and the ECCKiila framework.","tags":null,"title":"High-Assurance Field Inversion for Curve-Based Cryptography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Geraldo M.

In particular, these works argue that the discrete galois transform (DGT) is a better candidate for this particular case. However, these claims were never rigorously validated, and only intuition was used to argue in favor of each transform. This work brings some light on the discussion by developing similar CUDA implementations of the CKKS cryptosystem, differing only in the underlying transform and related data structure. We ran several experiments and collected performance metrics in different contexts, ranging from the basic direct comparison between the transforms to measuring the impact of each one on the inference phase of the logistic regression algorithm. Our observations suggest that, despite some specific polynomial ring configurations, the DGT in a standalone implementation does not offer the same performances of the NTT. However, when we consider the entire cryptosystem, we noticed that the effects of the higher arithmetic density of the DGT on other parts of the implementation are substantial, implying a considerable performance improvement of up to 15% on the homomorphic multiplication. Furthermore, this speedup is consistent when we consider a more complex application, indicating that the DGT suits better the target architecture.","tags":null,"title":"Performance of hierarchical transforms in homomorphic encryption: a case study on logistic regression inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hernán Vanegas","Daniel Cabarcas","Diego F.

We modify the Wagner-Fischer edit distance algorithm, aiming at reducing the number of rounds of the protocol, and achieve a flexible protocol with a trade-off between rounds and multiplications. We implement our proposal in the MP-SPDZ framework, and our experiments show that it reduces the execution time respectively by 81% and 54% for passive and active security with respect to a baseline implementation in a LAN.

Practical protocols usually rely on tested designs such as the mixing-and-decryption paradigm. There, multiple servers verifiably shuffle encrypted ballots, which are then decrypted in a distributed manner. While several efficient protocols implementing this paradigm exist from discrete log-type assumptions, the situation is less clear for post-quantum alternatives such as lattices. This is because the design ideas of the discrete log-based voting protocols do not carry over easily to the lattice setting, due to specific problems such as noise growth and approximate relations. This work proposes a new verifiable secret shuffle for BGV ciphertexts and a compatible verifiable distributed decryption protocol. The shuffle is based on an extension of a shuffle of commitments to known values which is combined with an amortized proof of correct re-randomization. The verifiable distributed decryption protocol uses noise drowning, proving the correctness of decryption steps in zero-knowledge. Both primitives are then used to instantiate the mixing-and-decryption electronic voting paradigm from lattice-based assumptions. We give concrete parameters for our system, estimate the size of each component and provide implementations of all important sub-protocols. Our experiments show that the shuffle and decryption protocol is suitable for use in real-world e-voting schemes.","tags":null,"title":"Verifiable Mix-Nets and Distributed Decryption for Voting from Lattice-Based Assumptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

Similarly, threshold ring signatures allow several signers to sign the same message on behalf of a group; while the combined signature reveals that some threshold t of the group members signed the message, it does not leak anything else about the signers’ identities. Anonymity is a central feature in threshold ring signature applications, such as whistleblowing, e-voting and privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies: it is often crucial for signers to remain anonymous even from their fellow signers. When the generation of a signature requires interaction, this is difficult to achieve. There exist threshold ring signatures with non-interactive signing—where signers locally produce partial signatures which can then be aggregated—but a limitation of existing threshold ring signature constructions is that all of the signers must agree on the group on whose behalf they are signing, which implicitly assumes some coordination amongst them. The need to agree on a group before generating a signature also prevents others—from outside that group—from endorsing a message by adding their signature to the statement post-factum. We overcome this limitation by introducing extendability for ring signatures, same-message linkable ring signatures, and threshold ring signatures. Extendability allows an untrusted third party to take a signature, and extend it by enlarging the anonymity set to a larger set. In the extendable threshold ring signature, two signatures on the same message which have been extended to the same anonymity set can then be combined into one signature with a higher threshold. This enhances signers’ anonymity, and enables new signers to anonymously support a statement already made by others. For each of those primitives, we formalize the syntax and provide a meaningful security model which includes different flavors of anonymous extendability. In addition, we present concrete realizations of each primitive and formally prove their security relying on signatures of knowledge and the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. We also describe a generic transformation to obtain extendable threshold ring signatures from same-message-linkable extendable ring signatures. Finally, we implement and benchmark our constructions.","tags":null,"title":"Count Me In! Extendability for Threshold Ring Signatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

While in recent history a typical industrial control system would have been isolated with rudimentary ways of extracting data, nowadays it is becoming expected that the control system could not only provide large amounts of data over the network but also receive firmware updates and patches. To this end it is important to secure the communication between the components of the system, as well as ensure that only approved components can communicate together. Secure communication and device authentication could be achieved by use of cryptographic keys and certificates. The system however must be able to securely manage the keys and certificates in order to ensure their authenticity and validity. In this paper we present a prototype of a pluggable key management device for industrial control systems with a key management protocol and integrated formal analysis of the running system – a model in-the-loop. This allows the system to continuously analyse the network traffic according to the protocol using VDM and hence assure compliance with several security properties.

Our findings were disclosed to the affected parties in December 2021 and since then the system has been updated to render most of our attacks ineffective.

Our scheme is also the first construction from candidate post-quantum secure assumptions to defend against compromise of the voter's computer using return codes. We implemented our protocol and present benchmarks of its computational runtime. The size of the verifiable shuffle is 22τ KB and takes time 33τ ms for τ voters. This is around 5 times faster and 40 % smaller per vote than the lattice-basedvoting scheme by del Pino et al. (ACM CCS 2017), which can only handle yes/no-elections.","tags":null,"title":"Lattice-Based Proof of Shuffle and Applications to Electronic Voting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

Designing an efficient protocol with the desired functionality has, however, been an open challenge for a long time. Recently, Di Crescenzo et al. (CARDIS’20) proposed the first suite of protocols for securely and efficiently delegating pairings with online inputs under the presence of a malicious server. We progress along this path with the aim of LOVE (Lowering the cost of Outsourcing and Verifying Efficiently) a pairing. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a protocol (LOVE) that improves the efficiency of Di Crescenzo et al.’s proposal for securely delegating pairings with online, public inputs. Second, we provide the first implementation of efficient protocols in this setting. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our LOVE protocol in different application scenarios by benchmarking an implementation using BN, BLS12 and BLS24 pairing-friendly curves. Interestingly, compared to Di Crescenzo et al.’s protocol, LOVE is up to 29.7% faster for the client, up to 24.9% for the server and requires 23–24% less communication cost depending on the choice of parameters. Furthermore, we note that our LOVE protocol is especially suited for subgroup-secure groups: checking the correctness of the delegated pairing requires up to 56.2% less computations than evaluating the pairing locally (no delegation). This makes LOVE the most efficient protocol to date for securely outsourcing the computation of a pairing with online public inputs, even when the server is malicious.","tags":null,"title":"LOVE a Pairing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Guimarães","Edson Borin","Diego F.

In this paper, we introduce two methods to combine multiple functional bootstraps to accelerate the evaluation of reasonably large look-up tables and highly precise functions. We thoroughly analyze and experimentally validate the error propagation in both methods, as well as in the functional bootstrap itself. We leverage the multi-value bootstrap of Carpov et al.

Although these weak instances are not addressed by worst-case hardness theorems, enabling other ring instantiations enlarges the scope of possible applications and favors the diversification of security assumptions. In this work, we extend the Ring-LWE problem in lattice-based cryptography to include algebraic lattices, realized through twisted embeddings. We define the class of problems Twisted Ring-LWE, which replaces the canonical embedding by an extended form. By doing so, we allow the Ring-LWE problem to be used over maximal real subfields of cyclotomic number fields. We prove that Twisted Ring-LWE is secure by providing a security reduction from Ring-LWE to Twisted Ring-LWE in both search and decision forms. It is also shown that the twist factor does not affect the asymptotic approximation factors in the worst-case to average-case reductions. Thus, Twisted Ring-LWE maintains the consolidated hardness guarantee of Ring-LWE and increases the existing scope of algebraic lattices that can be considered for cryptographic applications. Additionally, we expand on the results of Ducas and Durmus (Public-Key Cryptography, 2012) on spherical Gaussian distributions to the proposed class of lattices under certain restrictions. As a result, sampling from a spherical Gaussian distribution can be done directly in the respective number field while maintaining its format and standard deviation when seen in Zn via twisted embeddings.","tags":null,"title":"The Ring-LWE Problem in Lattice-Based Cryptography: The Case of Twisted Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caio Hoffman","Diego F.

Different approaches have emerged to exploit information leakage on cryptographic implementations and to protect them against these attacks, and recent works extend the concerns to dynamic execution systems [3, 15, 24]. However, little has been said about Cross-ISA emulation and its impact on timing leakages. In this paper, we investigate the impact of dynamic binary translators in the constant-time property of known cryptographic implementations, using different Region Formation Techniques (RFTs). We show that the emulation may have a significant impact by inserting non constant-time constructions during the translation, leading to significant timing leakages in QEMU and HQEMU emulators. These leakages are then verified using a statistical approach.

It is known that any small amount of nonce exposure or nonce bias can in principle lead to a full key recovery: the key recovery is then a particular instance of Boneh and Venkatesan's hidden number problem (HNP). That observation has been practically exploited in many attacks in the literature, taking advantage of implementation defects or side-channel vulnerabilities in various concrete ECDSA implementations. However, most of the attacks so far have relied on at least 2 bits of nonce bias (except for the special case of curves at the 80-bit security level, for which attacks against 1-bit biases are known, albeit with a very high number of required signatures). In this paper, we uncover LadderLeak, a novel class of side-channel vulnerabilities in implementations of the Montgomery ladder used in ECDSA scalar multiplication. The vulnerability is in particular present in several recent versions of OpenSSL. However, it leaks less than 1 bit of information about the nonce, in the sense that it reveals the most significant bit of the nonce, but with probability \u003c1. Exploiting such a mild leakage would be intractable using techniques present in the literature so far. However, we present a number of theoretical improvements of the Fourier analysis approach to solving the HNP (an approach originally due to Bleichenbacher), and this lets us practically break LadderLeak-vulnerable ECDSA implementations instantiated over the sect163r1 and NIST P-192 elliptic curves. In so doing, we achieve several significant computational records in practical attacks against the HNP.","tags":null,"title":"LadderLeak: Breaking ECDSA with Less than One Bit of Nonce Leakage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sara D.

Among the code families, QC-MDPC codes achieve the smallest key sizes while maintaining the desired security properties.

Comparing with the current state-of-the-art, the BIKE implementation, our code performs 1.9 times faster when decrypting messages. We then optimize the performance of QC-MDPC code-based cryptosystems through the insertion of a configurable failure rate in their arithmetic procedures. Using a failure rate negligible compared to the security level (2^-128), we achieve speedups of 1.6 to 2 times in some arithmetic algorithms. By inserting these algorithms in our enhanced version of QcBits, we were able to achieve a speedup of 1.9 on the key generation and up to 1.4 on the decryption time. Comparing with BIKE, our final version of QcBits performs the uniform decryption 2.7 times faster.

However, recent studies have practically demonstrated that such de-randomized schemes, including EdDSA, are vulnerable to differential fault attacks, which enable adversaries to recover the entire secret signing key, by artificially provoking randomness reuse or corrupting computation in other ways. In order to balance concerns of both randomness failures and the threat of fault injection, some signature designs are advocating a ``hedged'' derivation of the per-signature randomness, by hashing the secret key, message, and a nonce. Despite the growing popularity of the hedged paradigm in practical signature schemes, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to formally analyze the fault resilience of hedged signatures. We perform a formal security analysis of the fault resilience of signature schemes constructed via the Fiat--Shamir transform. We propose a model to characterize bit-tampering fault attacks, and investigate their impact across different steps of the signing operation. We prove that, for some types of faults, attacks are mitigated by the hedged paradigm, while attacks remain possible for others.

Although smart meters tend to encrypt payloads using state-of-the-art solutions, the packet length variability introduced by compression of the data can be exploited in a side channel attack to gain knowledge about the consumption of individual meters. For example, a meter reporting constant (e.g. zero) consumption can be compressed more than one reporting more erratic usage. An attacker may gain knowledge of behavioral patterns of a household, e.g., when is no one home, or company, e.g., active periods of production. This paper analyzes the correlation between compressed packet length and reported consumption of multiple signals and practical reporting periods for the DLMS standard using real (anonymized) smart meter measurements. We consider various built-in compressors and also propose new techniques that can both increase the compression and reduce this correlation.

Nowadays a critical component of control systems is the key management protocol for protecting communication. This is specifically important as more and more devices become part of industrial control networks. The key management system must be reliable and robust in order to ensure stable operation of the system with minimum downtime. This often means that the system needs to be autonomous and dynamic, capable of periodically changing the keys automatically and authenticating the system components. Different techniques have been used to examine the reliability and robustness of the key management systems, one promising approach is by using formal methods. In this paper we present a formally verified key management system for use within distributed industrial control systems. We demonstrate that the key management system can reliably handle authentication/communication operations in real-time as well as joining/leaving of control units within the system.

After that, the effort continued beyond the initial disclosure by monitoring security issues in these apps every six months, concluding that security posture oscillates quite a bit as mobile apps receive interface overhauls and new features frequently. These results produced a technical report, which was novel in conducting such an extensive security analysis over a significant amount of time (4 years).\nIn the last few years, the project has been expanded and adapted the initial prototype for my courses in Network and Systems Security. The result is a final assignment using industry-standard tools for students to conduct security analysis that considers aspects of software security, network communication, authentication mechanisms, and privacy. Around 50 Android applications (mainly from Denmark) have been analyzed using this methodology, which surfaced numerous vulnerabilities in the insecure deployment of cryptography and API design, weak authentication workflows, and session management. In several cases, the vulnerabilities were critical enough to warrant extremely careful disclosure to the interested parties using secure means.\nA remarkably successful example that illustrates the effort was the detection of vulnerabilities related to inadequate information disclosure, social engineering threats, and Denial of Service attacks during the deployment of the new MitID system.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"644277219a8c8913fb5c46cce245921e","permalink":"/project/mobisec/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mobisec/","section":"project","summary":"Security analysis of MitID and other mobile apps","tags":["Active"],"title":"Mobile Security","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Zero-knowledge proofs are integral for deploying privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, as they represent a fundamental building block for proving statements about confidential data.\nThe most popular framework for such proofs is based on cryptographic pairings defined over elliptic curves, where pairing-based zero-knowledge Succint Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) underlie private transactions.\nThere has been substantial progress in the past decade towards selecting parameters and implementing pairing-based cryptography efficiently in software.

Consequently, it is not necessary to move information from servers to clients or to reprocess requests due to concurrency. Unfortunately, existing proposals for extensible distributed coordination do not provide security and privacy once servers access data in plaintext.

Our aim is to describe and implement the simplest possible solution to provide data integrity in cloud-based scenarios.

Our construction generalizes Boneh et al.’s linearly homomorphic signature scheme (PKC’09 [7]) to the multi-key setting and relies on basic tools of pairing-based cryptography. Compared to existing multi-key homomorphic signature schemes, our MKLHS is a conceptually simple and elegant direct construction, which trades-off privacy for efficiency. The simplicity of our approach leads us to a very efficient construction that enjoys significantly shorter signatures and higher performance than previous proposals. Finally, we implement MKLHS using two different pairing-friendly curves at the 128-bit security level, a Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve and a Barreto-Naehrig curve. Our benchmarks illustrate interesting performance trade-offs between these parameters, involving the cost of exponentiation and hashing in pairing groups. We provide a discussion on such trade-offs that can be useful to other implementers of pairing-based protocols.","tags":null,"title":"The Simplest Multi-key Linearly Homomorphic Signature Scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This website tracks visitors using Google Analytics.\n","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"This website tracks visitors using Google Analytics.","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Versão arquivada de matéria publicada no blog Ciência \u0026amp; Matemática.\nA urna eletrônica foi implantada gradualmente entre 1996 e 2000, até as eleições se tornarem inteiramente digitais. O objetivo era eliminar fraudes na contagem pública dos votos, que aconteciam de maneira centralizada e com muita interferência. Foi um projeto pioneiro e audacioso na época, quando o impacto do voto eletrônico ainda era desconhecido. Por se tratar de tecnologia nova, a primeira eleição eletrônica contou com impressão de votos individuais. O mecanismo foi também tentado em algumas urnas em 2002 e posteriormente abandonado por ser considerado redundante e caro pelo Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE).\nTestes de segurança A (in)segurança do sistema continuou obscura até o começo dessa década, quando o TSE deu início aos Testes Públicos de Segurança. Foram 4 edições até hoje e, em todas elas, alguma vulnerabilidade foi encontrada afetando propriedades de segurança do equipamento, seja o sigilo do voto ou integridade dos resultados. Falhas cada vez mais graves foram descobertas ao longo do tempo, na medida que os participantes foram se familiarizando com o sistema e aprendendo a contornar as restrições dos testes. Para citar algumas dessas restrições, são apenas 3 dias para examinar dezenas de milhões de linhas de programação e é proibido usar papel para anotar trechos de código. Há recursos que ainda persistem fora de escopo dos testes, como a identificação biométrica.\nMesmo com esses obstáculos, os testes tem sido úteis para detectar algumas vulnerabilidades e erros de projeto. A edição de 2009 mostrou como quebrar o sigilo do voto após captura de rádio emitido pelo teclado da urna. Na edição de 2012, primeira com acesso ao código-fonte, coordenei o time que mostrou como quebrar o sigilo do voto de autoridades ou seções eleitorais inteiras utilizando apenas informação pública para recuperar os votos de maneira ordenada. Também detectamos falhas em outros mecanismos de segurança, como compartilhamento massivo e armazenamento inseguro de segredos para proteção do sistema (as chamadas chaves criptográficas). Para uma analogia com o mundo real, considere um cadeado que imediatamente perde sua segurança caso a chave seja roubada. No caso da urna, o segredo estava armazenado no próprio código-fonte, de forma análoga a embaixo do tapete.\nA próxima edição aconteceu apenas anos mais tarde, em 2016, mostrando como adulterar resultados de eleição em pequena escala utilizando o Sistema de Apuração, acionado em caso de contingência para digitação manual de resultado parcial da urna. Esse foi o primeiro ataque com sucesso à integridade dos resultados, mas a maior surpresa estava reservada para 2017, quando duas equipes alcançaram objetivos inéditos. Peritos da Política Federal conseguiram recuperar chaves criptográficas ao inicializar o sistema em um simulador. O time que integrei, composto por Pedro Barbosa (UFCG), Thiago Cardoso (Hekima), Caio Lüders (UFPE) e Paulo Matias (UFScar), explorou uma série de vulnerabilidades para adulterar o comportamento do software de votação. Injetamos pequenos programas de nossa autoria para fazer várias maldades, como violar o sigilo do voto de eleitores específicos, inserir mensagens na tela para fazer boca de urna e interferir com armazenamento dos votos. Só não conseguimos desviar votos entre candidatos por uma questão de poucas horas, pois tínhamos controle sobre o programa. Nossa abordagem foi pensada para um fraudador que captura cartões de memória que instalam software nas urnas antes das eleições, sabendo que cada cartão instala até 50 máquinas. Uma das vulnerabilidades utilizadas foi o armazenamento inseguro de segredos, detectado em 2012 e ainda não totalmente resolvido.\nA urna eletrônica é segura e transparente? Mesmo com todas as restrições e a impossibilidade de se fazer uma análise de segurança completa do sistema, os testes produzem relatórios dos problemas encontrados, com recomendações de ajuste. Dessa forma, a equipe de desenvolvimento do TSE tenta determinar qual a melhor forma de se mitigar ou resolver os problemas. Ainda assim, algumas falhas são estruturais e exigem esforço importante de reformulação que às vezes tomam anos. Também não há garantia de que a correção vai persistir, já que o desenvolvimento continua até bem perto da eleição, passando pela janela em que os partidos políticos podem inspecionar o código. Nada impede que existam outras vulnerabilidades mais graves ou correções sejam revertidas. Essa é a natureza de qualquer software e é por isso que a comunidade técnica não acha boa idéia realizar eleições utilizando apenas programas de computador, agravada pela necessidade de se auditar dezenas de milhões de linhas de código (\u0026ldquo;linha a linha\u0026rdquo;, segundo o TSE).\nAlém das vulnerabilidades já encontradas, há um problema ainda maior e que termina ofuscado. Conforme demonstrado na tentativa inconclusiva de auditoria após a eleição de 2014, o sistema de votação falha em uma de suas principais finalidades: provar para a sociedade que o resultado está correto. Eventuais auditorias ficam restritas a especialistas que precisam examinar toneladas de arquivos produzidos pelas urnas, sem a garantia de que funcionaram honestamente. O grande problema é que uma fraude minimamente sofisticada em escala razoável, especialmente se montada com colaboração interna, pode terminar indetectável.\nO que fazer? O voto impresso é um recurso adicional de transparência e consiste em um registro em papel apresentado para o eleitor, para fins de conferência e recontagem. O objetivo é aprimorar a transparência do sistema, possibilitando que cada eleitor verifique seu voto individual, mas sem fornecer uma prova material de suas escolhas. Em resumo, a introdução do voto impresso procura tornar transparente a contagem eletrônica dos votos, ao produzir uma evidência verificada pelo eleitor do comportamento honesto do sistema.\nHá certa confusão entre o mecanismo proposto e a \u0026ldquo;votação em papel\u0026rdquo;, mas são coisas bem diferentes. O voto é impresso e autenticado pela urna eletrônica, permanecendo na seção eleitoral. Fica evidente também que não basta imprimir o voto e pronto. É preciso instruir os eleitores a verificarem seus votos impressos e alertar contra manipulações indevidas na trilha física. Em caso de disputa ou conferência preventiva, a comparação das contagens em papel e eletrônica revela qualquer divergência que não seja feita de maneira compatível nos dois registros, aumentando em muito o custo de uma fraude. A ideia é forçar o fraudador a manipular tanto o software quanto os votos impressos depositados nas seções eleitorais.\nA tentativa atual de introdução do voto impresso veio de lei aprovada por ampla maioria em 2015, após várias tentativas sem sucesso. Citando dificuldades logísticas e de orçamento, o TSE decidiu implementá-la gradualmente, começando com 30 mil urnas (ou 5% das seções eleitorais). Apesar de ser um número pequeno, a decisão da implantação gradual foi acertada, pois alterar a tecnologia e procedimentos de uma só vez em todas as seções eleitorais não é decisão sensata do ponto de vista de segurança.\nMas o voto impresso não viola o sigilo? A implantação do voto impresso foi suspensa no dia 6 de junho, após julgamento pelo Supremo Tribunal Federal. O principal argumento foi o risco de violação do sigilo do voto, mas a possibilidade é remota. O voto impresso é examinado dentro da cabine de votação e não revela informação além da disponível na tela da própria urna. É também estranha essa argumentação, quando o sigilo já foi quebrado nos testes de segurança por erro de projeto; e o mesmo dispositivo é utilizado para receber tanto a identidade do eleitor quanto o seu voto. Outros pontos mencionados foram o valor do investimento, ignorando o custo social da falta de transparência e o montante gasto em privilégios do Judiciário; e a ineficiência de se contar milhões de votos manualmente, que pode ser facilmente contornada por amostragem estatística.\nO principal obstáculo à adoção do voto impresso é a oposição declarada do TSE, muito influente no STF. A manifestação técnica do Tribunal defende o velho argumento de que o voto impresso resgata as fraudes de antigamente e reintroduz a ação humana no processo eleitoral. Ora, o software é programado e instalado por humanos, que concentram poder desproporcional sobre o sistema! O voto impresso apenas tenta distribuir parte do controle para o eleitor, maior interessado na lisura do pleito.\nPor mais que tecnólogos muitas vezes observem apenas as virtudes da tecnologia, vale lembrar que as eleições servem à sociedade, e não o contrário. A grande maioria dos países que adotam voto eletrônico já implementaram registro físico. O Brasil não pode simplesmente ficar para trás e continuar com eleições impossíveis de verificar.\n","date":1529452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529452800,"objectID":"9d717c2f84650b4652a33e2b96106713","permalink":"/post/voto-impresso/","publishdate":"2018-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/voto-impresso/","section":"post","summary":"Voto impresso pode tornar eleições mais seguras e transparentes","tags":null,"title":"[pt_BR] Registro físico do voto eletrônico?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Pedro Geraldo M.

With the increasing demand for low-cost devices, PUF designs which can effectively combine small silicon area and power consumption with high resistance to attacks have become of great interest. Unfortunately, many delay-based PUFs have revealed security weaknesses, making them less useful in such domains. This paper presents a novel delay-based strong PUF, the CRPUF (Cylindrical Reconvergence PUF). CRPUF is based on a carefully designed cylindrical XOR fabric, which allows for a large number of delay paths, thus producing a large combination of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) with relatively low transistor count. Simulations based on circuit delay variability models were performed to evaluate CRPUF with respect to well-known delay PUFs. The simulation results were then validated against an FPGA prototype to show that the desirable properties of the CRPUF can be obtained in a realistic physical implementation.

If the execution time of an implementation depends on secret information, an adversary may recover the latter through measuring the former. Different approaches have emerged recently to exploit information leakage on cryptographic implementations and to protect them against these attacks. However, little has been said about ISA emulation and its impact on timing attacks. In this paper, we investigate the impact of an emulator (dynamic binary translator), OI-DBT, using different Region Formation Techniques (RFTs) on constant-time and non-constant-time implementations of cryptographic algorithms. We show that emulation can have a significant impact on secret leakages, even mitigating them in some cases. Moreover, our results indicate that the choice of RFT heuristic by the emulator does have an impact on these leakages.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of Timing Side-Channel Leakage on a Multiple-Target Dynamic Binary Translator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

This results in protocols presenting computational and communication complexities that are prohibitive, particularly in the case when one of the participants is a low-powered device and there are bandwidth restrictions. This paper builds on modern cryptographic engineering techniques and proposes optimizations for a promising one-way PSI protocol based on public-key cryptography.

Há várias formas de se aprimorar o sistema atual, com variados ganhos em transparência e custos de implementação, mas antes de discuti-las é importante analisar, sob um ponto de vista crítico, o modelo atual de auditoria de software e dos resultados da eleição.\nModelo atual de auditoria A resolução 23.458/2015 do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) estabelece o modelo de fiscalização do sistema de votação antes das eleições. Determina que fiscais formalmente indicados por partidos políticos e Congresso Nacional, órgãos do Judiciário (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil, Ministério Público, Supremo Tribunal Federal, Controladoria-Geral da União) e técnicos da Polícia Federal, Sociedade Brasileira de Computação, Conselho Federal de Engenharia e universidades \u0026gt; “possuem acesso antecipado aos programas de computador desenvolvidos pelo Tribunal Superior Eleitoral ou sob sua encomenda a serem utilizados nas eleições, para fins de fiscalização e auditoria, em ambiente específico e controlado pelo Tribunal Superior Eleitoral.”\nOs programas incluem o software de votação, sistemas de preparação do equipamento e demais componentes de software que interagem, direta ou indiretamente, com as urnas eletrônicas e totalização dos seus resultados. Enquanto na teoria parece um mecanismo suficiente e adequado de auditoria, na prática o resultado é outro. Primeiramente, há um Termo de Confidencialidade mandatório que limita a atuação e divulgação das informações coletadas pelos fiscais. Além de limitar a disseminação de informação técnica sobre o sistema de votação, o termo certamente não é capaz de impedir a divulgação interna, em um partido, de vulnerabilidades encontradas por um fiscal malicioso. Também não há registro anterior de indicação de fiscais por parte da OAB ou MP, entidades que deveriam representar a sociedade no processo, mas se omitem possivelmente por questões políticas. Observa-se, portanto, que a fiscalização tem sido realizada tradicionalmente apenas por fiscais partidários, representando entidades com conflito de interesse direto com o resultado. Espera-se que a recente ampliação para incluir fiscais apartidários colabore com a participação de um número maior de pesquisadores, e mais qualificados.\nHá também outras limitações de natureza técnica, como a janela limitada de 6 meses para fiscalização dos programas, mesmo com alterações ainda em curso; a restrição do ambiente controlado pelo TSE, limitando as ferramentas de auditoria; e a alta complexidade causada por um conjunto de programas com enorme volume de código. Há maior transparência no processo de totalização de resultados, com a comparação entre Boletins de Urna físicos e eletrônicos, mas obstáculos logísticos também dificultam sua realização, conforme observado pelo Projeto Você Fiscal e tentativa de auditoria por partidos políticos. Resta torcer para que partidos concorrentes se anulem em eventual atuação maliciosa, ignorando o fato elementar de que eleições são financiadas também com recursos públicos e servem, antes de tudo, aos próprios eleitores.\nTestes Públicos de Segurança Uma oportunidade com menos restrições aparentes é a participação nos Testes Públicos de Segurança (TPS), organizados desde 2009 e se encaminhando para a quarta edição. O evento é defendido pelo TSE como requisito suficiente do ponto de vista de transparência, mas repete vários dos problemas presentes na auditoria antes das eleições. O formato com poucos dias de duração, o escopo limitado que não inclui subsistemas importantes (como identificação biométrica e totalização, entre outros), as intervenções do Tribunal na definição das regras, seleção dos interessados e abordagens de ataque; e a imposição desde 2016 de um Termo de Confidencialidade representam condições de trabalho que não modelam tentativas realistas de fraude, em contraste direto à liberdade de pesquisa exercitada em outros países.\nApesar das restrições, os testes tem sido úteis para revelar vulnerabilidades no sistema, dado seu nível de insegurança, conforme observado em todas as suas edições: — A edição de 2009, que não fornecia acesso ao código-fonte dos programas, revelou vazamento de informação crítica útil para quebra do sigilo do voto no teclado da urna eletrônica. — Na edição de 2012, a equipe sob minha coordenação e composta pelos técnicos da UnB Marcelo Monte Karam, André de Miranda e Felipe Scarel, sagrou-se campeã após detectar e explorar com sucesso uma vulnerabilidade no único mecanismo da urna para proteger o sigilo do voto utilizando apenas informação pública. O ataque era essencialmente não-rastreável por não exigir alteração de qualquer componente da urna ou invasão de seu perímetro de segurança. Além da proteção inadequada do sigilo, foram também observada diretamente no código-fonte a utilização de algoritmos criptográficos obsoletos, a presença e compartilhamento massivo de chaves criptográficas e verificação insuficiente de integridade do software de votação. Esta última era realizada pelo próprio equipamento, de forma passiva, abrindo a possibilidade de adulteração indetectável do software e seus produtos. — Já nos testes de 2016, o técnico Sérgio Freitas da Silva explorou com sucesso pela primeira vez uma vulnerabilidade na integridade de resultados, ao permitir a um mesário malicioso falsificar resultados de um Boletim de Urna digitado manualmente após condição de contingência.\nO sucesso aparente dos TPS não deveria ser encarado com tanto entusiasmo. O sistema de votação eletrônica está em operação no Brasil há mais de 20 anos e as possibilidade de auditoria continuam restritas a especialistas e sob controle absoluto do Tribunal, em conflito de interesse direto com o espírito da iniciativa. É improvável que tantas vulnerabilidades e erros de projeto, descobertos na ocasião em apenas poucas horas de investigação, tivessem permanecido desconhecidas por tanto tempo em um sistema que já fosse auditável por qualquer profissional qualificado do governo, academia ou indústria. Para tanto, é fundamental reduzir ao máximo a barreira de entrada para qualquer esforço de auditoria.\nEspera-se que a edição de 2017 seja a mais transparente até hoje, mas um rápido exame do edital de participação demonstra o nível de burocratização e as inúmeras restrições de tempo, ferramentas e escopo impostas aos pesquisadores. Vale ressaltar que um fraudador dedicado e persistente, possivelmente com acesso privilegiado aos sistemas por representar ou corromper agente interno ao Tribunal, não terá que se submeter a nenhuma dessas regras e restrições. É surpreendente que eleições puramente eletrônicas ainda utilizem tecnologia que não seja diretamente e irrestritamente auditável pela sociedade ou seus representantes.\nUm novo modelo A adoção de tecnologias verdadeiramente livres, tanto no software quanto no hardware das urnas eletrônicas, pode ampliar substancialmente a transparência do sistema. Assim como a adoção pelo TSE do sistema operacional GNU/Linux em 2008, em um movimento louvável, foi defendida sob o argumento da segurança e independência de tecnologias proprietárias, as mesmas propriedades se aplicam ao software desenvolvido pelo próprio Tribunal. Além de permitir trivialmente auditoria independente da tecnologia eleitoral, verificação de alegações de natureza técnica do Tribunal e contribuições por parte da sociedade, a disponibilização do sistema sob licenças livres possui outra grande vantagem, ligeiramente mais sutil.\nQuando confrontados com a possibilidade de verificação independente da qualidade do sistema e seus mecanismos de segurança, uma equipe de desenvolvimento que preza por sua reputação e credibilidade não possui alternativa além de aprimorar as suas práticas e projeto, resultando em um sistema mais seguro e confiável. Desde que haja interesse da comunidade técnica para auditar o sistema, a pressão externa se torna um incentivo formidável para incremento de qualidade.\nProblema resolvido? Infelizmente, a disponibilidade de software e hardware sob licenças livres ou possibilidade de sua auditoria por especialistas são requisitos necessários, mas não suficientes para garantir eleições inteiramente seguras e transparentes. Mesmo que a tecnologia seja minuciosamente examinada por fiscais independentes, não há garantia técnica de que o mesmo sistema foi utilizado no dia da eleição. A utilização de compilação determinística, permitindo a criação de versões reprodutíveis dos programas em formato binário, e assinaturas digitais para verificação ativa da integridade do software não impedem que atuação maliciosa interna comprometa instalações individuais do sistema. O processo de compilação e geração de mídias de instalação para um sistema dessa magnitude é complexo e pode ser difícil de reproduzir externamente, dadas as inúmeras dependências. A verificação ativa de integridade também exige a presença de fiscais na abertura das seções eleitorais, software adicional para validação das assinaturas digitais e acesso direto ao conteúdo do equipamento. Finalmente, a fiscalização das eleições não deveria ser limitada a profissionais que dominam conhecimento técnico, mas estendida à toda a sociedade.\nPor esse motivo, o caminho para eleições seguras e transparentes não envolve apenas a adoção de tecnologia auditável e sua livre disponibilização, mas também a implementação de um registro físico e anônimo do voto, que junto com procedimentos adequados para auditoria e recontagem, distribuam a todos os eleitores a possibilidade de verificar o registro correto de seus votos, a exemplo do resto do mundo. Nada mais natural, visto que são os eleitores os maiores interessados no processo democrático. Felizmente, o Congresso Nacional aprovou lei reintroduzindo o voto impresso nas eleições de 2018. Resta observar se haverá algum aumento de transparência com a implantação do recuso pelo Tribunal e se o esforço se expandirá rapidamente para além dos 5% de urnas eletrônicas inicialmente planejados.

Na imensa maioria dos casos, introduzir algoritmos ou computadores não elimina a intervenção humana, mas apenas transfere e amplifica o controle para humanos responsáveis pela implementação e operação do sistema.\nNa medida que aspectos tecnológicos controlam e mediam partes cada vez maiores e mais importantes de nossas vidas, nasce o estudo de transparência algorítmica, dedicado a projetar sistemas que fornecem evidências verificáveis de seu funcionamento justo. As aplicaçães são inúmeras e vão desde viés na ordenação dos resultados de busca à mineração de dados para detecção de terroristas entre passageiros de avião. Para dar uma idéia da dificuldade do problema, escrever um programa que verifica se outro programa qualquer sempre funciona corretamente é uma tarefa insolúvel em computação, de forma que outros mecanismos precisam ser utilizados para resolver problemas bem mais específicos.\nNo país, essa questão já foi levantada inúmeras vezes a respeito das garantias fornecidas pelo sistema de votação eletrônica utilizado em eleições oficiais. Para todos os propósitos práticos, o software de votação é secreto para os próprios eleitores, que terminam obrigados a confiar em seu correto funcionamento. Há um esforço periódico de auditoria por especialistas, mas as condições de trabalho são tão restritas que dificilmente uma equipe qualificada terá possibilidade de examinar uma porção significativa do sistema. Em 2012, liderei a equipe vencedora dos Testes Públicos do Sistema Eletrônico de Votação, ao explorar o comportamento nada imprevisível do mecanismo de embaralhamento para quebrar o sigilo do voto . Desde então, foi introduzido um Termo de Confidencialidade que limita a natureza da informação disseminada publicamente por investigadores participantes. A resistência contra a introdução de um registro físico do voto no sistema de votação demonstra claramente que a relação entre transparência e o Judiciário brasileiro não é das melhores.\nA questão entra em pauta novamente com o sistema de distribuição aleatória de processos pelo Supremo Tribunal Federal. É até curioso que novamente a pergunta recaia sobre aleatoriedade! O problema parece muito simples, tal como o de embaralhar votos: basta sortear números de maneira imprevisível dentro de um intervalo, como em uma loteria comum. O problema é que computadores nao são capazes de gerar valores imprevisíveis por si só, mas apenas expandir a imprevisibilidade contida em outra informação (\u0026ldquo;semente\u0026rdquo;) por meio de operações aritméticas. A semente deve então ser coletada preferencialmente de um fenômeno físico complexo. Ou seja, as condições iniciais do gerador são fundamentais para determinar se o sorteio pode ser manipulado ou não. As tentativas até agora de explicar como funciona o algoritmo do STF não relevam absolutamente nada de importante, e o problema mora nos detalhes, então resta esperar por uma auditoria séria e com resultados públicos. Mas como provar para um cidadão comum que o sistema correto está realmente em execução em momentos decisivos?\nHá algumas soluções promissoras na literatura científica, que envolvem utilizar resultados de loterias múltiplas como semente de um gerador, permitindo que o comportamento correto seja verificado após o fato. A vedete mais recente utiliza blockchains, componentes de moedas eletrônicas como o Bitcoin, para realizar o sorteio de maneira distribuída e verificável. Transparência é um requisito fundamental para garantir o funcionamento correto de um sistema computacional de interesse público, por isso não deixemos que os algoritmos da Justiça faltem justamente com a justiça de seus resultados.\nAtualização de 2022: O grupo de pesquisa em criptografia da USP projetou um protocolo dedicado para resolver o problema.\n","date":1486425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486425600,"objectID":"b86317b31f57333119827754d0bb59e9","permalink":"/post/transparencia-justica/","publishdate":"2017-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/transparencia-justica/","section":"post","summary":"Como provar que o sistema correto está realmente em execução em momentos decisivos?","tags":null,"title":"[pt_BR] Algoritmo Supremo: transparência e justiça","type":"post"},{"authors":["Armando Faz-Hernández","Hayato Fujii","Diego F.

In this paper, we keep pushing in this direction and study efficient implementation of regular scalar multiplication algorithms for binary curves equipped with efficient endomorphisms. Our focus is on implementing the Galbraith-Lin-Scott (GLS) family of binary curves by exploring the space of different models and laddering algorithms, for their high performance, reasonable implementation simplicity, lower memory consumption and side-channel resistance.

In particular, hash values of large collections can be computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a very useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity verification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding. Unfortunately, constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature are hampered by two main drawbacks: they tend to be much longer than usual hash functions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of 2^128, they are several thousand bits long, as opposed to 256 bits for usual hash functions), and they are also quite slow. In this paper, we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH), which combines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient encoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one hand, the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal: 2m-bit hash values provide O(2^m) collision resistance. On the other hand, we demonstrate a highly-efficient software implementation of ECMH, which our thorough empirical evaluation shows to be capable of processing over 3 million set elements per second on a 4 GHz Intel Haswell machine at the 128-bit security level---many times faster than previous practical methods.","tags":null,"title":"Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hilder Vitor L.

Its design is based on 4-bit S-boxes and a 64-bit permutation, a far from optimal choice to achieve good performance in software. As a result, most software implementations require large lookup tables in order to meet efficiency goals. In this paper, we describe a new portable and efficient software implementation of PRESENT, fully protected against timing attacks. Our implementation uses a novel decomposition of the permutation layer, and bitsliced computation of the S-boxes using optimized Boolean formulas, not requiring lookup tables. The implementations are evaluated in embedded ARM CPUs ranging from microcontrollers to full-featured processors equipped with vector instructions. Timings for our software implementation show a significant performance improvement compared to the numbers from the FELICS benchmarking framework. In particular, encrypting 128 bits using CTR mode takes about 2100 cycles on a Cortex-M3, improving on the best Assembly implementation in FELICS by a factor of 8. Additionally, we present the fastest masked implementation of PRESENT for protection against timing and other side-channel attacks in the scenario we consider, improving on related work by 15%. Hence, we conclude that PRESENT can be remarkably efficient in software if implemented with our techniques, and even compete with a software implementation of AES in terms of latency while offering a much smaller code footprint.","tags":null,"title":"PRESENT Runs Fast - Efficient and Secure Implementation in Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edson Floriano","Eduardo Alchieri","Diego F.

Tuples stored in a tuple space are accessed by the contents of their fields, working as an associative memory. Although there are some proposals for secure tuple spaces, accessing tuples through field contents makes these systems susceptible to attacks that could impair user and data privacy, since servers must access tuple data. In order to deal with these limitations and provide privacy in the tuple space model, this paper proposes some extensions to DEPSPACE, a tuple space system that implements dependability and security properties through a set of mechanisms that are not enough to ensure privacy. The resulting system provides privacy and, at the same time, allows tuple selection/matches similar to the traditional insecure model, i.e., it does not constraint the matching possibilities. The main problem to be addressed is that servers must select tuples based on their contents without knowing them. The proposed solution uses robust cryptographic schemes, as order-preserving encryption and homomorphic encryption, to provide this functionality without revealing the tuple contents. An analysis concerning security aspects of DEPSPACE is presented, as well as the benefits of the proposed solutions. A set of experiments, executed with an implementation of the proposed protocols, shows the feasibility of the proposed solutions and shed some light on both the behavior of the system and the costs to provide privacy in the tuple spaces model.","tags":null,"title":"Providing privacy on the tuple space model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo B.

As the demand for IoT devices grows, the need for stronger authentication and access control mechanisms is greater than ever. Legacy authentication and access control mechanisms do not meet the growing needs of IoT. In particular, there is a dire need for a holistic authentication mechanism throughout the IoT device life-cycle, namely from the manufacturing to the retirement of the device. As a plausible solution, we present Authentication of Things (AoT), a suite of protocols that incorporate authentication and access control during the entire IoT device life span. Primarily, AoT relies on Identity- and Attribute-Based Cryptography to cryptographically enforce Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Additionally, AoT facilitates secure (in terms of stronger authentication) wireless interoperability of new and guest devices in a seamless manner. To validate our solution, we have developed AoT for Android smartphones like the LG G4 and evaluated all the cryptographic primitives over more constrained devices like the Intel Edison and the Arduino Due. This included the implementation of an Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) scheme. Our results indicate AoT ranges from highly efficient on resource-rich devices to affordable on resource-constrained IoT-like devices. Typically, an ABS generation takes around 27 ms on the LG G4, 282 ms on the Intel Edison, and 1.5 s on the Arduino Due.","tags":null,"title":"AoT: Authentication and Access Control for the Entire IoT Device Life-Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The project goal was to develop training materials and use cases for secure blockchain applications.

The solution allowed voters to verify if results were correctly transmitted to the central tabulator without manipulation, with granularity of individual polling places. We present results, discuss limitations of the approach and future perspectives, considering the context of the previous Brazilian presidential elections of 2014, where the proposed solution was employed for the first time. In particular, with the aid of our project, voters were able to verify 1.6 % of the total poll tapes, amounting to 4.1 % of the total votes, which prompted the electoral authority to announce improved support for automated verification in the next elections.

Active data injection attacks in the communication channel, side channels, or the device itself are also greatly facilitated.

With the increasing demand of low-cost devices, PUF designs which can effectively combine small silicon area and power consumption with high resistance to attacks have become of great interest. Unfortunately, many delay-based PUFs have revealed security weaknesses, making them less useful in such domains. This paper presents a novel delay-based strong PUF, the CRPUF (Cylindrical Reconvergence PUF). CRPUF is based on a carefully designed cylindrical XOR fabric, which allows for a large number of delay paths, thus producing a large combination of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) with relatively low transistor count. Simulations based on circuit delay variability models were performed to evaluate CRPUF with respect to well-known delay PUFs. Experimental results show that CRPUF has Hamming Distance, Hamming Weight and Entropy comparable to the best results published so far, with acceptable levels of Bit Error Rate. Moreover, experiments also show that CRPUF is much more resistant to modeling attacks than other delay and some memory-based PUFs, making it a good candidate to systems which have stringent cost and security constraints.","tags":null,"title":"Cylindrical Reconvergence Physical Unclonable Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rafael J.

In this context, the present research project proposes a co-design approach (cryptographic software making use of architectural support in the hardware) for the protection of embedded devices operating under IoT environments. The objective is to design and implement lightweight cryptographic schemes for IoT devices and other embedded platforms, integrating them with architecture-provided instruction-level side-channel resistance. The combination of hardware and software resources should be validated both by formal analysis of the running software and experimental evaluation of the architecture features.\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d40a2f1d9146dc993247d1086e6f65e3","permalink":"/project/secexec/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/secexec/","section":"project","summary":"Secure execution of cryptographic algorithms","tags":null,"title":"SecExec","type":"project"},{"authors":["Diego F.

This graph relies on Ferrante et al.'s notion of control dependences to represent implicit flows of information. A limitation of this approach is that it may create O(|I| × |E|) implicit flow edges in the PDG, where I are the instructions in a program, and E are the edges in its control flow graph. This paper shows that it is possible to compute information flow analyses using a different notion of implicit dependence, which yields a number of edges linear on the number of definitions plus uses of variables. Our algorithm computes these dependences in a single traversal of the program's dominance tree. This efficiency is possible due to a key property of programs in Static Single Assignment form: the definition of a variable dominates all its uses. Our algorithm correctly implements Hunt and Sands system of security types. Contrary to their original formulation, which required O(I 2) space and time for structured programs, we require only O(I). We have used our ideas to build FlowTracker, a tool that uncovers side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic algorithms. FlowTracker handles programs with over one-million assembly instructions in less than 200 seconds, and creates 24% less implicit flow edges than Ferrante et al.'s technique. FlowTracker has detected an issue in a constant-time implementation of Ellip-tic Curve Cryptography; it has found several time-variant constructions in OpenSSL, one issue in TrueCrypt and it has validated the isochronous behavior of the NaCl library.","tags":null,"title":"Sparse representation of implicit flows with applications to side-channel detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hilder Vitor L.

Tiny manufacturing costs, stringent security, and ultra-low power operation constraints have considerably raised SoC design requirements. More than incremental approaches which try to re-use current cryptographic mechanisms, the new generation of IoT devices will require novel solutions which deeply integrate their hardware-intrinsic features to program execution. This paper proposes a low-cost PUF-based authentication architecture aiming to secure code execution in IoT SoCs. The solution is deeply embedded into the processor micro-architecture, so as to minimize re-design costs and performance penalties. This new architecture model not only deals with the most common threats against code and data authenticity and integrity, but also provides an approach to extract from processor’s caches a stable and unpredictable key that is used in the code and data authentication process.","tags":null,"title":"Computer security by hardware-intrinsic authentication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Geraldo M.

(ACM CCS 2013), which is simple but supports a somewhat limited set of elliptic curves, and its variant \"Elligator Squared\" suggested by Tibouchi (FC 2014), which is slightly more complex but supports arbitrary curves. Despite that complexity, it was speculated that Elligator Squared could have an efficiency edge in some contexts, as it avoids a rejection sampling step necessary for Elligator, and can be used with a larger class of point encoding functions, some of them very efficient. In this paper, we show that Elligator Squared can indeed be implemented very efficiently with a suitable choice of point encoding function. More pre-cisely, we consider the binary curve setting, and implement the Elligator Squared bit string representation algorithm based on a suitably optimized version of the Shallue–van de Woestijne characteristic 2 encoding. On the fast binary curve of Oliveira et al. (CHES 2013), our implementation runs in an average of only 22850 Haswell cycles. We also compare implementations of Elligator and Elligator Squared on a curve supported by Elligator, namely Curve25519, and find that generating a random point and its uniform bitstring representation is around 35–40% faster with Elligator for protocols using a fixed base point (such as static ECDH), but 30–35% faster with Elligator Squared in the case of a variable base point (such as ElGamal encryption). Both are significantly slower than our binary curve implementation.","tags":null,"title":"Binary Elligator Squared","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomaz Oliveira","Diego F.

In such implementations, a scalar multiplication [k]P is computed as a double multiplication [k1]P + [k2]ψ(P), for ψ an efficient endomorphism and k1,k2 appropriate half-size scalars. To compute a random scalar multiplication, one can either select the scalars k1,k2 at random, hoping that the resulting k = k1 + k2 λ is close to uniform, or pick a uniform k instead and decompose it as k1 + k2 λ afterwards. The main goal of this paper is to discuss security issues that may arise using either approach. When k1 and k2 are chosen uniformly at random in [0,√n) , n = ord(P), we provide a security proofs under mild assumptions. However, if they are chosen as random integers of   ⌊12log2n⌋  bits, the resulting k is slightly skewed, and hence not suitable for use in schemes like ECDSA. Indeed, for GLS curves, we show that this results in a bias of up to 1 bit on a suitable multiple of   kmodn , and that this bias is practically exploitable: while lattice-based attacks cannot exploit a single bit of bias, we demonstrate that an earlier attack strategy by Bleichenbacher makes it possible. In doing so, we set a record by carrying out the first ECDSA full key recovery using a single bit of bias. On the other hand, computing k1 and k2 by decomposing a uniformly random k ∈ [0,n) avoids any statistical bias, but the decomposition algorithm may leak side-channel information. Early proposed algorithms relied on lattice reduction and exhibited a significant amount of timing channel leakage. More recently, constant-time approaches have also been proposed, but we show that they are amenable to power analysis: we describe a template attack that can be combined with classical lattice-based attacks on ECDSA to achieve full key recovery on physiscal devices.","tags":null,"title":"GLV/GLS Decomposition, Power Analysis, and Attacks on ECDSA Signatures with Single-Bit Nonce Bias","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno C.

Durante o evento, foram detectadas vulnerabilidades no software que permitiram a recuperação em ordem dos votos computados. Apresentamos cenários onde as vulnerabilidades permitem a possibilidade de fraude eleitoral e sugestões para se restaurar a segurança dos mecanismos afetados. Também são apontadas outras fragilidades no software e nas práticas utilizadas para confecção do mesmo. Em particular, este relatório versa sobre os principais problemas de projeto e/ou implementação de mecanismos de segurança detectados no software da urna eletrônica: Proteção inadequada do sigilo do voto: os votos são armazenados fora de ordem, mas é trivial recuperá-los em ordem a partir unicamente dos produtos públicos de uma eleição e conhecimento superficial do código-fonte, também de acesso público aos partidos políticos; Cifração inadequada: a mesma chave criptográfica é utilizada para cifrar as mídias de todas as urnas eletrônicas. Utilizando a analogia clássica de um cadeado como abstração de técnica criptográfica, isto é equivalente a proteger meio milhão de cadeados com uma mesma chave, visto ser este o número aproximado de equipamentos em opera-ção. Além disso, a chave que decifra todas as mídias é armazenada às cLARAs na porção decifrada das mídias. Utilizando a mesma analogia, isto equivale a esconder a chave do cadeado embaixo do tapete e confiar no segredo dessa localização como fonte de segurança; Utilização de algoritmos obsoletos: a função de resumo criptográfico utilizada não mais oferece a segurança esperada para sua aplicação em verificação de integridade. Esta aplicação específica da função escolhida não é mais recomendada há pelo menos 6 anos; Formulação equivocada do modelo de atacante: há ênfase demasiada no projeto de mecanismos resistentes apenas a atacantes externos, quando agentes internos representam risco muito maior; Processo de desenvolvimento defeituoso: práticas inseguras permitem a inserção acidental ou maliciosa de vulnerabilidades de software, cLARAmente atestando que o processo de desenvolvimento adotado pelo TSE é imaturo do ponto de vista de segurança; Verificação insuficiente de integridade: o software da urna eletrônica verifica sua própria integridade durante o processo de inicialização, mas toda a informação necessária para subverter esse mecanismo encontra-se armazenada nas próprias urnas eletrônicas, com dificuldades distintas para um ataque, dependendo da presença do módulo de segurança em hardware. Em urnas sem este recurso, o problema de verificação é reduzido a si próprio, sem fonte externa de confiança. Nesse caso, \"software auto-verificável\" por assinatura digital equivale a confiar a autenticidade de uma assinatura de punho em um documento apenas ao testemunho do próprio ``autor'', que, assim, pode se passar por quem quiser. É importante ressaltar ainda que uma assinatura autêntica apenas atesta o processamento do conteúdo assinado em algum ponto no tempo e espaço no qual também estava presente a chave de assinatura. Mesmo que os mecanismos de verificação de integridade não sejam contornados e funcionem a contento, ainda não há qualquer garantia de que o conteúdo do documento é de fato o desejado, visto que no caso o mesmo (software) tem extensão da ordem de milhões de linhas (de código). Caso o software possua vulnerabilidades (como as descritas neste documento), a verificação de integridade (quando não subvertida) tem o efeito colateral de garantir que as mesmas vulnerabilidades estarão presentes em todas as urnas. A versão do código observada pelos autores apresentava ainda como desativada a verificação de integridade de parte do software contido na urna, evidenciando as limitações intrínsecas da técnica. Mais detalhes a respeito dos problemas acima são fornecidos no decorrer deste relatório, mas pode-se observar de antemão que vários dos recursos implementados no software da urna eletrônica não representam mecanismos de segurança, mas apenas de ofuscação, não resistindo a colaboradores internos ou atacantes persistentes. Como vários dos problemas encontrados resultam de falhas arquiteturais ou premissas inadequadas de projeto, é improvável que a intervenção pontual em algumas dessas questões resolva as causas fundamentais para a sua ocorrência. É imprescindível que se execute revisão crítica completa dos processos de desenvolvimento de software para que se estabeleçam boas práticas que tenham condições de evitar que novas vulnerabilidades sejam inseridas acidentalmente ou intencionalmente por agentes maliciosos internos ou externos. Como o modelo de urna eletrônica adotado no Brasil depende exclusivamente da integridade do software para se atingir integridade dos resultados, os problemas discutidos aqui adquirem uma caráter crítico e exigem urgência na introdução de mecanismos que permitam a auditabilidade de resultados independente do software. Apenas com uma revisão de práticas e instalação de metodologia científica para avaliação contínua do sistema, é possível que o software da urna eletrônica satisfaça requisitos mínimos e plausíveis de segurança e transparência.","tags":null,"title":"Vulnerabilidades no software da urna eletrônica brasileira","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego F.

Por essa razão, durante seis dias do mês de Março de 2012, o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral realizou testes públicos para avaliar a qualidade dos mecanismos de segurança implementados no equipamento.\nA equipe sob minha coordenação e composta pelos técnicos da UnB Marcelo Monte Karam, André de Miranda e Felipe Scarel, sagrou-se campeã do evento por detectar e explorar com sucesso uma vulnerabilidade no único mecanismo da urna para proteger o sigilo do voto. Esse mecanismo tem como objetivo dessassociar a ordem de votação dos eleitores da ordem de armazenamento dos votos em um arquivo de acesso público chamado Registro Digital do Voto (RDV), produzido pelo software da urna desde 2003. A recuperação instantânea e exata da lista ordenada de votos dependeu unicamente de informação pública, sendo essencialmente não-rastreável por não exigir alteração de qualquer componente da urna ou invasão de seu perímetro de segurança. Posteriormente, descobriu-se ainda que a urna eletrônica também armazena em arquivo público o instante de tempo em que cada voto é confirmado. Caso não seja corrigida, a vulnerabilidade abre a possibilidade de violação do sigilo do voto de todos os eleitores de uma seção eleitoral, a partir da monitoração da ordem em que votaram; e de revelação de alguns votos específicos inseridos em instantes de tempo conhecidos. Várias outras fragilidades com diferentes graus de gravidade foram encontradas no software, abrangendo desde a utilização de técnicas criptográficas obsoletas ou fora de seus limites de operação, até o compartilhamento massivo de uma mesma chave criptográfica, com impacto devastador em caso de vazamento.\nÉ certo que as fragilidades e vulnerabilidades podem ser corrigidas, mas uma leitura cuidadosa do cenário é bastante reveladora. A vulnerabilidade foi detectada já na primeira hora de estudo do software, a partir da busca de trechos de código conhecidamente inseguros. A reprodução em software de missão crítica de uma vulnerabilidade conhecida desde 1995, quando foi encontrada no navegador Netscape 1.1, permite observar claramente que alguns princípios de projeto empregados são inadequados e que o processo de desenvolvimento do software da urna eletrônica ainda é imaturo do ponto de vista de segurança. O RDV foi instituído como substituto do voto impresso para permitir a verificação dos totais parciais presentes no Boletim de Urna a partir da lista embaralhada de votos, mas é tão vulnerável quanto o que tenta proteger, pois ambos são produzidos exatamente pelo mesmo componente de software. Em seus nove anos de história, o arquivo não serviu a nenhum propósito além de fragilizar o sigilo do voto quando projetado e implementado de forma insegura. O objetivo do voto impresso é aprimorar a transparência do sistema, possibilitando que cada eleitor verifique seu voto individual, sem no entanto fornecer para o mesmo uma prova material de suas escolhas. Se implantado corretamente com depósito automático em urna convencional, permite verificar a integridade da contagem eletrônica a partir da contagem dos registros impressos e conferidos pelos eleitores, aumentando significativamente a dificuldade de uma fraude indetectável ao exigir que intervenções perfeitamente coerentes sejam realizadas nas versões digital e impressa dos votos. Ironicamente, o retorno do voto impresso a partir das eleições de 2014 foi suspenso com o argumento de que supostamente representa ameaça ao caráter secreto do voto.\nO Brasil permanece como o único país do mundo a resistir ao movimento internacional na direção da adoção de mecanismos para verificação independente dos resultados de eleição, uma situação curiosa quando se considera que a segurança do sistema eletrônico de votação é componente crítico para fortalecimento da nossa democracia. Não há como aprimorá-lo sem oferecer a oportunidade permanente para especialistas da academia ou indústria contribuir positivamente com avaliações independentes do sistema, sem restrições artificiais de tempo e com métricas e critérios científicos; ou até mesmo para qualquer cidadão brasileiro, por meio do exercício do direito individual de verificar que seu voto foi computado corretamente.\n","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343779200,"objectID":"227e2ad0d6c381cc90fa71d80c32254d","permalink":"/post/aprimorando-voto-eletronico/","publishdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/aprimorando-voto-eletronico/","section":"post","summary":"Versão arquivada de matéria publicada em 2012 na revista ADESG.\nA confiabilidade dos resultados das eleições brasileiras depende principalmente da qualidade e integridade do software de votação utilizado nas urnas eletrônicas.","tags":null,"title":"[pt_BR] Aprimorando o sistema eletrônico brasileiro de votação","type":"post"},{"authors":["Diego F.

Field arithmetic is carefully crafted by using the best formulae and implementation strategies available, and the increasingly common native support to binary field arithmetic in modern desktop computing platforms. The i-th power of the Frobenius automorphism on Koblitz curves is exploited to obtain new and faster interleaved versions of the well-known $τ$NAF scalar multiplication algorithm. The usage of the $τ^łfloor m/3 f̊loor$ and $τ^łfloor m/4 ł̊oor$ maps are employed to create analogues of the 3-and 4-dimensional GLV decompositions and in general, the $łfloor m/s o̊̊or$-th power of the Frobenius automorphism is applied as an analogue of an $s$-dimensional GLV decomposition. The effectiveness of these techniques is illustrated by timing the scalar multiplication operation for fixed, random and multiple points. To our knowledge, our library was the first to compute a random point scalar multiplication in less than 10^5 clock cycles among all curves with or without endomorphisms defined over binary or prime fields. The results of our optimized implementation suggest a trade-off between speed, compliance with the published standards and side-channel protection.

Symmetric cryptosystems can perform it efficiently, but they often do not provide a perfect trade-off between resilience and storage.

Using Pairing-Based Cryptography (PBC) protocols parties can agree on keys without any interaction. In this work, we (i) show how security in WSNs can be bootstrapped using an authenticated identity-based non-interactive protocol and (ii) present TinyPBC, to our knowledge, the most efficient implementation of PBC primitives for 8, 16 and 32-bit processors commonly found in sensor nodes.

This facilitates public key validation but introduces the key escrow of private keys by the central authority as a side-effect. Certificateless cryptography (CL-PKC) is a novel paradigm where the generated costs are reduced without introducing key escrow of private keys. A signcryption scheme is a technique that provides confidentiality, authentication and non-repudiation in a single integrated operation.

On the other hand, the advent of cryptography from pairings has enabled a wide range of novel cryptosystems. In this work we present TinyTate, the first known implementation of pairings for sensor nodes based on the 8-bit/7.3828-MHz ATmega128L microcontroller (e.g., MICA2 and MICAz motes).

The behavior of distributed shared memory systems is dictated by the memory consistency model. In order to provide a better understanding on the semantics of the memory consistency models, many researchers have proposed formalisms to define them. Even with formal definitions, it is still difficult to say what kind of execution histories can be produced on a particular memory model. In this paper, we propose a tool that shows what operations orderings could lead to user-defined execution histories on different memory models. We also present a prototype of our tool that analyses execution histories for four different memory consistency models: sequential consistency, PipelinedRAM consistency, release consistency and scope consistency.","tags":null,"title":"Obtaining possible execution histories on multiple memory consistency models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hammurabi C.

O comportamento dos sistemas DSM é determinado pelo modelo de consistência da memória. De modo a prover melhor compreensão sobre a semântica dos modelos de consistência da memória, vários pesquisadores propuseram formalismos para defini-los. Mesmo com definições formais, ainda é difícil dizer que tipos de históricos de execução podem ser produzidos em um determinado modelo de consistência. Neste artigo, é proposto um framework que serve como base para a implementação da análise de históricos de execução em diversos modelos de consistência, provendo os algoritmos e estruturas de dados convenientes para tal. O nosso framework é organizado em módulos e permite que o usuário defina novos modelos de consistência de uma maneira simples. Um protótipo foi implementado em C, incluindo também os programas que lidam com históricos em PipelinedRAM e Release Consistency. Quando comparados com suas implementações originais, o uso do framework permitiu uma redução de em torno de 70% no tamanho do código para os dois modelos.","tags":null,"title":"Um framework para definição e análise de modelos de consistência de memória","type":"publication"}]
